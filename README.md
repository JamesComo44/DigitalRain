## Ethan's To Do List
1. Feature: Type out a phrase and hit enter -> that phrase appears on the screen like
   "HELLO WORLD!" does in your prototype. Hit escape -> the phrase "melts away" as the
   raindrops resume their descent. Rinse and repeat.
   * User Input Controller Handler Manager Driver
2. Refactor to Options pattern using .NET configuration lib.
3. Refactor to Ninject (or other) DI container.  Can you rewrite combinations from (1) as
   config files now?
